    "# Tutorial 01: Running Sumo Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through the process of running non-RL traffic simulations in Flow. Simulations of this form act as non-autonomous baselines and depict the behavior of human dynamics on a network. Similar simulations may also be used to evaluate the performance of hand-designed controllers on a network. This tutorial focuses primarily on the former use case, while an example of the latter may be found in `tutorial09_controllers.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we simulate a initially perturbed single lane ring road. We witness in simulation that as time advances the initially perturbations do not dissipate, but instead propagates and expands until vehicles are forced to periodically stop and accelerate. For more information on this behavior, we refer the reader to the following article [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Components of a Simulation\n",
    "All simulations, both in the presence and absence of RL, require two components: a *network*, and an *environment*. Networks describe the features of the transportation network used in simulation. This includes the positions and properties of nodes and edges constituting the lanes and junctions, as well as properties of the vehicles, traffic lights, inflows, etc. in the network. Environments, on the other hand, initialize, reset, and advance simulations, and act the primary interface between the reinforcement learning algorithm and the network. Moreover, custom environments may be used to modify the dynamical features of an network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Setting up a Network\n",
    "Flow contains a plethora of pre-designed networks used to replicate highways, intersections, and merges in both closed and open settings. All these networks are located in `flow/networks`. In order to recreate a ring road network, we begin by importing the network `RingNetwork`."
